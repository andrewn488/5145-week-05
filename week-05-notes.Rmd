# 05-01: Chp 12 Totals and Aggregations

+ Summarization & Aggregation
+ Totals & Analytics
+ Get the data then summarize and analyze the data

## Overview

+ Aggregates

    + COUNT
    + SUM
    + AVG
    + MAX
    + MIN
    + STDEV / STDEVP ("P" = population)
    + VAR / VARP ("P" = population)
    
+ Uses

    + How many in one area compared to all other locations?
    + Variance of something for a group of people?
    + Average of something for a group of people?
    + What should we be focusing in on?
    
+ Structure

    + Looks like expressions in the SELECT statement

## Count

+ COUNT (*) <- returns the number of items in a group ("count my rows")
+ COUNT (ALL expression) <- evaluates the expression for each row in a group, for non-null values

    + Do COUNT (*) and COUNT (expression) to track nulls if that's interesting 
    
+ COUNT (DISTINCT expression) <- evaluates the expression for each row in a group

    + returns "unique" results
    + for non-null values
    
+ Examples

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e;
        + Results: 290 rows
    
    SELECT COUNT(ALL e.Title)
    From HumanResources.Employee AS e;
        + Results: 290 rows with titles in them (doesn't count the number of titles)
        
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e.Title)
    From HumanResources.Employee AS e;
        + Results: 67 distinct titles used in the table
        
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    From HumanResources.Employee AS e
    WHERE e.DeptID = 3;
        + Results: 45 rows
        
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    From HumanResources.Employee AS e
    INNER JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d
    ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
    WHERE e.DeptID = 'Sales';
        + Results: 45 rows
        + Returns number of employees in the Sales department

## SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN

+ function (ALL expression)
    
    + evaluates the expression for each row in a group
    + Ignores null values
    
+ function (DISTINCT expression)

    + Evaluates the expression for each row in a group
    + returns "unique" results
    + ignores null values

+ Examples

    SELECT MAX(list_price)
    FROM sales.order_items AS i
    
    SELECT AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary)
    FROM employees AS e
        + strictly for numeric processing
        + unable to select columns from table not aggregating
        
+ Rules

    + function ()
        + ALL <- applies the aggregate function to all values. ALL is the default
        + DISTINCT <- specifies that the function() operates only on one **unique instance of each value**, regardless of how many times that value occurs
        + *expression* <- an expression of the exact numeric or approximate numeric data type category
    + Other than COUNT, all functions are for numeric columns ONLY

## Hands On

+ Practice in Virtual Desktop

## STDEV, VAR

+ Examples

    SELECT STDEV(s.Bonus)
    FROM Sales.Salesperson AS s;
    
    SELECT AVG(s.Bonus), SUM(s.Bonus),
      STDEV(s.Bonus), VAR(s.Bonus)
    FROM Sales.Salesperson AS s
    
+ Population <- use entire dataset of population
    
    + Use STDEV, VAR when analyzing subset of population
    + Use STDEVP, VARP when analyzing entire population

# 05-02: Chp 13 Grouping

+ If no groupby() function, would need to write separate queries and UNION everything on top of each other

## Grouping

+ Using the GROUP BY feature after WHERE, before ORDER BY
+ Summarizes data into "groups"
    
    + Usually this means columns or expressions
    SELECT YEAR(OrderDate), SUM(OrderAmount)
    FROM Sales.Orders
    GROUP BY Year(OrderDate);
    
+ Rules

    + Direct relationship between: 
        + SELECT Columns/Expression
        + GROUP BY clause
    + Columns not used in aggregate functions MUST be used in the GROUP BY
    
+ ORDER BY

    + GROUP BY
        + Gathers rows into groups AND
        + Sorts the groups alphabetically on the columns in the GROUP BY clause
    + ORDER BY
        + Sorts the result set by individual rows
        + MUST be the last clause in a query
        + ORDER BY COUNT(*) will order by numerical order


## GROUP BY Examples

+ Talking thru some examples and use cases

## GROUP BY Subqueries

+ tool in creating "virtual" tables
+ legal to include in FROM or WHERE
+ must follow the rules on GROUP BY
+ build the query to perform the analysis for you to be repeatable with current data

## GROUP BY Hands On

+ Practice using AdventureWorks2012

# 05-03: Chp 14 Filtering Groups

## Filtering Grouped Data

+ limitations to WHERE clause
+ filtering with GROUP BY can help enhance WHERE clause (HAVING)
+ HAVING <- clause to filter grouped data

    + acts like a WHERE clause on the grouped rows
    + For filtering GROUP BY rows, after aggregation
    + And... because the WHERE clause cannot be used on aggregate functions
    SELECT c.Country, COUNT(c.CustomerID)
    FROM Customers AS c
    WHERE c.Region IN ('Europe', 'Asia')
    GROUP BY c.Country
    + WHERE clause interacts directly with FROM clause
    + HAVING clause interacts directly with GROUP BY clause
    + HAVING performs like a WHERE clause, but is applied to the filtered data
    HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5  # only returns countries that have > 5 customers
    
+ Rules

    + HAVING only acts on rows **after** they have been grouped
    + Can ONLY compare columns/expressions included in the SELECT clause
    SELECT YEAR(s.OrderDate), SUM(s.OrderAmount)
    FROM Sales.Orders AS s
    GROUP BY YEAR(s.OrderDate)
    HAVING SUM(s.OrderAmount) > 5000 (AND s.Territory = 3)
    
![](WHEREvsHaving.png)
    

## Examples

+ WHERE clause operates on ungrouped rows
+ Need to filter AFTER the grouping occurs <- HAVING
+ HAVING can filter on aggregated data
+ Create and use virtual tables to your advantage

    + can apply WHERE when using FROM subquery

+ Equivalent queries: 

    SELECT DepartmentName, COUNT(*)
    FROM Employee AS e
      INNER JOIN Department AS d
      ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY DepartmentName
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    
    SELECT *
    FROM 
      (SELECT DepartmentName AS dept, COUNT(*) AS empCnt
      FROM Employee AS e
      INNER JOIN Department AS d
      ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
      GROUP BY dept
      ) AS grp
    WHERE grp.empCnt > 1;

## Hands On

# 05-04: Chp 21 Advanced GROUP BY

+ Class should be relaxed now
+ Need to run totals
+ Need to group by a certain way, summarize it, and calculate subtotals and totals
+ GROUP BY Advanced

    + GROUP BY goes beyond simple aggregations
    1. ROLLUP <- calculate totals in a hierarchy
    2. CUBE <- generate totals on all possible combinations
    3. GROUPING SETS <- calculate totals on Union of TOtals
    + Subclauses that simplify creating multiple grouping sets
    + Important for Data Analysts (ME!!!)
    
+ ROLLUP

    + Summarize sales amount by year and month
    SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS YEar, 
      MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
      SUM(TotalDue) AS Total
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2006
    GROUP BY 
      ROLLUP(YEAR(OrderDate), 
        MONTH(OrderDate));
        
    + Creates a group for each combination
    + Moves from right to left
    
    GROUP BY ROLLUP(col1, col2, col3, ...)
    -------------------------------------
    col1, col2, col3
    col1, col2, NULL
    col1, NULL, NULL
    NULL, NULL, NULL (Grand Total)
    
+ CUBE

    + provides totals for every single combination of columns it has
    + Summarize sales amount by year and month
    SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS YEar, 
      MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
      SUM(TotalDue) AS Total
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2006
    GROUP BY 
      CUBE(YEAR(OrderDate), 
        MONTH(OrderDate));
        
+ GROUPING SETS 

    + Run a summary or generate a total for the unique values in each column
    + Generate sales amounts by years and months
        SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS YEar, 
      MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
      SUM(TotalDue) AS Total
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) > 2006
    GROUP BY 
      GROUPING SETS(YEAR(OrderDate), 
        MONTH(OrderDate));

# Office Hours 4/27/2022

+ EXISTS vs. ANY VS. IN

    + All similar to OR
    + Mostly a performance dealio
    + If something meets the criteria, EXISTS is 
    + EXISTS is like an IF statement - returns TRUE values or not at all
    + Choose to use EXISTS rather than IN when using a subquery
    
+ ROLL UP vs. CUBE vs. GROUPING SETS

    + Depends on what the objective is
    + CUBE <- returns aggregates for all values in columns (every possible combination)
        + returns entire dataset that you'd likely do something else with
        + returns a whole dataset
        + create massive dataset that combines many tables together
    + ROLL UP <- creates aggregate set based on hierarchy of columns selected
